        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <p>
          In retail forex trading, neither you nor the broker actually take
          ownership of the currencies being traded. When you place a trade, you
          and your broker enter into an agreement where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ✅ If you predict correctly, you earn the difference between the
            opening and closing price.
          </li>
          <li>
            ❌ If you predict incorrectly, you pay the difference to the broker.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This setup introduces counterparty credit risk the risk that the
          broker may not have enough capital to pay you if they default. Since
          your broker is the other party in your trade, ensuring they are
          well-capitalized and regulated is crucial for security.

        <h2>What are you actually trading?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You are entering into a contract with your broker, betting on
            whether the price of one currency will rise or fall against another.
          </li>
          <li>
            You don’t own the actual currency. You’re speculating on its price
            movements.
          </li>
          <li>
            The profit or loss comes from the difference in price between when
            you enter and exit the trade.

        <h2>Are the prices that your forex broker quotes you fair?</h2>

        <section id="broker-risk-management" class="container mt-4">
          <h2>When Forex Prices Are Fair</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Tied to Interbank Market Rates-</strong> If your broker
              operates under an A-Book model (Straight Through Processing or
              ECN), they simply pass market prices from liquidity providers to
              you without interference.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tight Spreads-</strong> If the bid-ask spread is low and
              competitive, it suggests minimal broker intervention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulated Brokers- </strong>Brokers regulated by reputable
              authorities (e.g., FCA, CFTC, ASIC) must follow strict pricing
              transparency rules.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>When Forex Prices May Be Manipulated</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>B-Book Brokers (Market Makers)-</strong> These brokers
              take the opposite side of your trade, meaning if you lose, they
              win. Some may manipulate prices to trigger stop-loss orders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Widened Spreads-</strong> During news events or volatile
              periods, some brokers artificially widen the spread to make
              trading more costly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Slippage & Requotes-</strong> If your broker frequently
              delays execution, leading to worse prices (negative slippage),
              they may be interfering with your trades.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Stop-Hunting-</strong> Some brokers push prices slightly
              past common stop-loss levels to force traders out before reversing
              the trend.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to Ensure Fair Pricing</h2>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>✔️ Choose an ECN/STP broker for direct market access.</li>
            <li>
              ✔️ Check a third-party price feed (like TradingView or Bloomberg)
              to compare your broker’s prices with actual market data.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✔️ Look for a broker with low slippage and transparent execution
              policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✔️ Avoid unregulated brokers, as they may manipulate prices with
              no oversight.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Is the forex broker a legit Company?</h2>
          <p>
            Not all forex brokers are legitimate! Some are trusted financial
            institutions, while others are
            <strong>scams designed to take your money</strong>. Here’s how you

            ✔️ Search for Complaints on forums like ForexPeaceArmy, Trustpilot,

        <h2>Is it a Real Company?</h2>
        <p>
          Some forex brokers are legitimate financial firms that are regulated
          by government authorities, while others are scam operations designed
          to take traders' money. If you want to check whether a specific broker

        </p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>✔️ Verify Regulation</li>
          <p>
            Legitimate brokers are regulated by financial authorities. Search
            for the broker’s name in these official databases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🇺🇸 CFTC/NFA (USA) - NFA BASIC</li>
            <li>🇬🇧 FCA (UK) - FCA Register</li>

          </p>

          <li>✔️ Check the Company’s Website & Contact Info</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Do they have a physical office address?</li>
            <li>Is their contact number real (not just an online form)?</li>
            <li>
              A real company should have a transparent "About Us" page with
